# live-rng

## Condition

The live CONQUER.EXE code/data mapping is verified independently against the
fingerprinted LE image and its relocations; a scripted full-game recorder
captures initial seeds, reseeds and every RNG draw as rule-tagged bound/result
records, rejects unmapped draws, and captures divergence/state diagnostics
locally. At least two original runs with different seeds verify the recorder
from a prescribed observable state, including trace completeness and ordering.
Synthetic safety/transport/recording checks and the documentation check pass.
RUNTIME.md gives repeatable commands and accurately records capability limits.
Completion requires the actual running game, not only loader or isolated calls.

## Scope

Areas: RNG, UI, MEDIA, SOUND, RES, SAVE, PERSON, STRATEGY, ASSAULT, BATTLE,
VIEW, ESTATE, TALK, DRAGON, JOUST, TOURNEY, CONFIG. Batches: research and
research-side tooling only. Inspect other areas only for evidence-backed RNG
caller ownership, necessary state reachability, and instrumentation validation.
Current runtime target: CONQUER.EXE. Other runtime analysis remains Later.

## Must not touch

Rebuild gameplay code under src/ and its implementation tests. Do not promote
claims from tooling success, modify the original executable or its installation,
commit proprietary bytes/captures/disassembly, or push without owner request.

## Dead ends

DOSBox-X debugger entry fails with redirected console handles, -noconsole or
CREATE_NO_WINDOW. Use the verified hidden native-console Release executable.
Debugger memory commands require numeric addresses and explicit dump filenames.

## Handover

- Stage: Survey; this goal adds runtime research capabilities.
- Last gate: 2026-10-09 tooling synthetic checks and documentation passed.
- Unfinished: none; the live mapping and recorder are not implemented yet.
- Blockers: none established. The current probe stops in the protected loader.
- Next: extend the probe to verify live LE objects and RNG entry/state identity;
  map RNG callers from spec evidence; build and validate deterministic recording.
